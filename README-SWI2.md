# Training a model to forecast soil water index (SWI) with gradient boosting

This code reproduces the data and model training and prediction workflows used in `Strahlendorff et al.: Gradient boosting-based soil wetness for forestry climate adaptation in HarvesterSeasons service -training a model to forecast soil water index from a comprehensive set of IFS model predictors in Destination Earth`

## Downloading the predictor and predictand (target) data
For training data preparation, we have a dozen time series scripts in Python that use the request219
module to make http-requests to our SmartMet server time series API. These scripts were used to220
obtain daily time series for all LUCAS locations from ERA5-Land, SWI, climatology for SWI, and221
the Leaf Area Index climatology for each day from 2015 to 2022. In addition, static variables, such as different land covers or inland water fractions, must be prepared as time series data. All these223
predictors and the predicted SWI are described in Annex 2. The API time series allows thousands of224
locations to be queried in one request in our time window. Based on the testing, it was most efficient to query 5000 locations in a single request. This method optimally uses the memory available on the SmartMet server. More locations in one request extended the responses from the server than asking 63 000 locations in 13 sequential queries.

## Training the model
The training scripts include one for performing the Optuna hyperparameter tuning runs and another229
for rendering with the best tuning settings: xgb-fit-optuna-swi2.py and xgb-fit-swi2.py. The same230
data are available for the lightGBM prefixed as the lgbm fit. These scripts are very similar to each231
other because both XGBoost and LightGBM are methods that are integrated with scikit-learn;232
therefore, training data are used from the same file, and the main differences in the scripts are the233
function calls and hyperparameter attributes that differ for the two tested methods. In addition to the234
fitting scripts, there are also Python scripts for K-fold analysis and cross-correlation, and scripts to235
plot figures for the location maps and feature importance.236

## Predicting soil water index
Predicting SWI2 requires two steps: The first experiment was performed as part of the get season. sh237
and get-edte.sh bash scripts. All input data must be re-gridded into the same grid in which the result238
is in. For seasonal forecasts it is the ERA5-Land grid for the European area from -30 degrees west to239
50 degrees east and 25 degrees north to 75 degrees north at 0.1 degrees increments. The EDTE was a240
0.04 Â°grid for the same bounds. These steps use the GNU parallel (Tange, 2021) and CDO by241
(Schulzweida, 2023). The second step was performed using our self-developed xgb-predict-swi2-242
era5l.py and -edte.py scripts. These Python scripts use Xarray (Hoyer, 2017) to join different input243
grids into one data frame that includes all time steps for each input in the target grid. This data frame244
was used by XGBoost to calculate the grid using the predicted SWI2
